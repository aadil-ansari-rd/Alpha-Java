/*
Number of Closed Islands in a Grid (Java):

1. Definition: A closed island is a group of 1s (land) completely surrounded by 0s (water) and not touching the boundary.

2. Approach:
   - Use DFS to traverse each land cell.
   - If DFS touches the boundary, mark the island as not closed.
   - Mark visited land cells as 0 to avoid revisiting.

3. Example Grid:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Output:
Number of closed islands: 1
